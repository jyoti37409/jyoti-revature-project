 Retrospective

During Sprint 1, the Planetarium Web Application demonstrated solid progress in building core functionalities 
such as adding moons to valid planet IDs, implementing cascade delete when a planet is removed, and ensuring 
proper UI updates when actions are taken. Navigation flows were smooth, with successful redirects and page 
loads upon completing major operations. The system consistently reflected user actions, particularly in the 
planet and moon tables, confirming that backend synchronization with the frontend was handled well. Overall, 
the application's fundamental workflows performed reliably when valid data was provided, contributing to a 
positive user experience for standard use cases.

However, several critical issues emerged during acceptance testing that need immediate attention. Validation errors,
especially around user registration and file uploads, were not handled gracefully, leading to user confusion and gaps 
in feedback. Found lacking, allowing improper entries like whitespace-only names to be accepted. These defects indicate
a need for more robust client-side validation, better error messaging, and stricter form input checks in the next sprint.
Strengthening these areas will enhance the systemâ€™s resilience to bad data, improve user clarity, and ensure higher 
quality releases moving forward.
