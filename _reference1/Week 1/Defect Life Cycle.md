# Defect Life Cycle
When you are done with testing, odds are you will have discovered some defects. Managing those defects has a lifecyle of its own

## 1. Identification
you have to find a defect before you can do anything with it

## 2. Triage
discovered defects need to be assigned priority and severity scores
- priority: how quickly does this need to be addressed?
- severity: how much of an impact does this defect have on the end user ability to use the service?

## 3. Assign
someone has to fix the defect

## 4. Fix
once assigned, attempt to fix

## 5. Verify or Reject
if you succeed, verify the fix actually solves the problem

if you think the defect is not a problem, reject it (think "it's not a bug, its a feature)

if you can't solve the problem, let your boss know and it gets reassigned

## 6 Close
mark the defect closed, archive it, move on
