# Gherkin Syntax
We can make use of "Gherkin Syntax" when creating our Acceptance Criteria in order to make our initial AC more compatible with the Cucumber framework we will start using in week 2. The primary keywords we can use at this time are the following:
- **Given**: indicates a starting condition for the acceptance criteria
- **When**: indicates an action taken to complete the acceptance criteria
- **Then**: indicates an expected outcome that indicates the user story has been completed as expected. Think of it as saying "X outcome should be achieved, if not, a defect has been discovered"
- **And**: indicates the step in the acceptance criteria is related to the previous step. Can be used with any other keyword
