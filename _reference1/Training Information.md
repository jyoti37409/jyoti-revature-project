# Training Software/Tools
- IDEs
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
        - I highly recommend you check the "Open with Visual Studio Code" options when you download VSC: while not necessary, it will provide a very nice quality-of-life feature for right clicking on a directory or file and opening it in VSC directly
        - the "Extension Pack for Java" extension has a great starting collection of extensions for working with Java and Maven in VSC, you should install them
        - VSC does not come with a JDK, so you will need to acquire one on your own. With the Java extensions you can use the VSC command pallet to download a JDK for use. I recommend the Temurin distribution
            - we will use JDK 11 in training
        - if you want to use Maven with VSC you will need to download it and set it up for use: [this](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) link will take you to the download page, and [this](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) link has setup instructions for configuring Maven to work on your machine
    - [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=&section=windows)
        - similar to VSC, I recommend enabling the option to "open with Intellij" to open directories directly with the application 
        - Intellij comes bundled with Maven and has an internal system for downloading and using JDKS, when setting up a project you can have Intellij download the JDK you need
- [Github Account](https://github.com/)
    - after you create a Github account you will need to install a local version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
        - If you decide to utilize GitBash, make sure the "Git Bash here" box is checked under Windows Explorer Integration on the Select Components page (not necessary, but a nice quality of life feature)
            - Git will work with other shells, but most training examples will make use of GitBash, so commands or path inputs for files may be different if you use a different shell
        - on the "Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new repositories" page I recommend you choose the lower option to override the default naming convention and choose the default name of "main". This is not necessary, but it will make things more consistent between your local Git software and your Github default settings
