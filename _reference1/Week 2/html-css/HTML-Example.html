            Header elements are typically used when you need to have a heading for a section on
            your page. There are 6 different header types, with h1 being the largest and h6 being
            the smallest

            Note when rendered these elements are all on separate "lines" of the page. This is 
            because header elements are "block" elements by default: they are designed to be
            rendered on their own "line" of the page, so no other elements are rendered on the
            same "line" as them
